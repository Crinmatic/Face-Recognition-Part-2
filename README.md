# Aim
Build a face recognition system using OpenCV and Deep Learning.

# Highlights
1. The codes are well documented for debugging purposes
2. Make sure a "Haar_cascade_classifier" is being downloaded 
3. The train_model.py comes first 
4. The model trained would be used in the "facerecognition" file
5. Enjoy!

# Improves needed
1. Building it's accuracy
2. And any other thing you feel should be added to make it better
